THIS IS A README FILE FOR GAMEOFLIFE : 
    as implemented by Shrawan Sreekumar (el20ss)

INSTRUCTIONS   :
    1.The game starts from the last saved state.
    2.To start a new game with a new grid size & generation cycles, 
        please change loadstate.txt
    3. Once loadstate.txt has been adjusted to your liking and saved,
        start the application and press 'l'. This will load the new 
        parameters into the system
    4. If you would like to continue from the previous state, no changes are necessary
    5. The grid cells can be changed from dead to alive and vice
        versa by clicking on them. Live cells are white and dead cells are black
    6. Once you are satisified with the grid size and layout of cells, press 'space' to
        begin the simulation. During run time no changes can be made to the grid. The simulation
        will run for the predetermined number of "generations" or steps.
    7. Once the simulation is complete, the application with come to a halt
    8. Following this, you can chose to save the grid by pressing 's' or exit the application using 'Esc"
    9. If you would like to continue testing, you can press 'r' to reset the grid, or continue with the
        present grid.
